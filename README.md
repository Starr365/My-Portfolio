## Usage

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-portfolio.git
    cd my-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm` as the package manager.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    The contact form requires an access key from [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/). Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your key:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
    ```

    You will need to update the `contact-section.tsx` file to use this environment variable instead of the hardcoded key.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
